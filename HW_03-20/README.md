1. Divisor Pattern Art
> Print a table of size NxN where an entry (i, j) is:
>
> * @ @ character + 1 space character if i divides j or j divides i
> * Two empty space characters, otherwise
>
> For example:
>
> @ @ @ @ @
> @ @   @
> @   @
> @ @   @
> @       @

2. Twenty Questions Game
> Write a program which assumes a random integer X in some range, say 1 - 100,000. It prompts you to input a number and responds with the following information:
>
> * Input number is higher than X
> * Input number is lower than X
> * Input number is equal to X, in which case you win the game Your program gives 20 chances to guess the number and you lose if you fail to guess.
>
> You can use Java's Math.random() to generate a random number. Note that it returns a double, but we want an int

3. Fibonacci
> The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
> Write a program which accepts as input an integer N and returns the N-th Fibonacci number.
> To test whether your program returned the correct number, go to Wolfram Alpha, and enter fibonacci(N) where N is your input integer

4. A Pretty Title
> Write a program that calls a method printTitle that prints a phrase as a title by,
>
> * converting it to title capitalization
> * underlining each word, i.e. underlying all characters except spaces

5. Bonus
> * Count Words - counts the number of words in a string
> * Avg Word Length - computes the average word length of a sentence
> * Reverse Words - reverses a string by order of words (rather than characters). Treat punctuation as part of a word.
