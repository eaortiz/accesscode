###Exercises

> 1. Write a method that prints the numbers 1 through 10 using a loop.
> 2. Write a method that prints the numbers 1 through 10 using a different kind of loop.
> 3. Write a method that takes in an `int` n and prints the numbers 1 through n.
> 4. Write a method that takes in an `int` n and prints the even numbers 2 through n.
> 5. Write a method that prints the sum of 1 through 10 using a loop.
> 6. Write a method that takes in an `int` n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 through n using a loop.
> 7. Use the method you wrote in part 6 to print the sum of the numbers from 1 through 10000.
> 8. Write a method that takes in an `int` n and a `String` s and prints out s on its own line, n times. If n is negative, print "".
