###Exercises

> 1. Write a method `isOdd` that takes in an `int` n. Returns a `true` if n is odd, and `false` otherwise.
> 2. Write a method `isMultipleOfThree` that takes in an `int` n. Returns `true` if n is a multiple of three, and `false` otherwise.
> 3. Write a method `isOddAndIsMultipleOfThree` that takes in an `int` n. Returns `true` if n is both odd and a multiple of three, and false otherwise.
> 4. Write a method `isOddAndIsMultipleOfThree2` - if you used `isOdd` and `isMultipleofThree` in your last solution, don't use it this time. If you did not, write this method building on your last methods.
> 5. Write a method `fizzMultipleofThree` that takes in an `int` n and prints "Fizz" if n is a multiple of three, and prints n otherwise.

Look at [Person.java](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0-assessment/blob/master/src/nyc/c4q/Person.java) from the assessment.

> 5. Write a method that takes in a `Person` and returns `true` if the person is from London, and `false` otherwise.
> 6. Write a method that takes in a `Person` and prints the name if the person has a name longer than 5 characters, and otherwise prints "Name is too short."
