#Unit 0 Assessment Redux!

###Installation & Submission

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub profile
2. Clone your forked copy into your `Desktop`

  ```
  git clone git@github:YOUR_USERNAME/unit-0-assessment-redux.git
  ```
3. `Import project` into IntelliJ
4. Read the `Singer` and `Unit0Exercises` classes
4. Fix the empty methods in `Unit0Exercises`
5. Add your changed files, commmit your changes, and push the changes to your forked repo

###Instructions

* You must fix all of the methods in `Unit0Exercises`
* There are optional bonus methods
* The name of the method implies what the method should do
* Some of these methods require that the method return signature change.
    * For example, `returnPrimitiveBooleanFalse()` should return `boolean`, not `Object`

###Hints

* You can use the `main` method to test your methods!
* Pay close attention to the method signatures and return values!
* You can use Google, StackOverflow, and the entire Internet :)
* Correct capitalization and spelling matter!
    * Names of locations, singers, ... should be spelled and capitalized **exactly** as they are in the method comments!


###Definitions

* The **sum** of `a` and `b`: `a + b`
* A number is **odd** if it is not divisible by 2
    * ex: `3` is **odd** because `3 % 2 == 0` is `false`
* A number is **even** if it is divisible by 2
    * ex: `4` is **even** because `4 % 2 == 0` is `true`
* `a` is a **multiple** of `b` if `a % b == 0` is `true`
