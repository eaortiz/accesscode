## Objectives
- To understand what wrapper classes are
- To become comfortable with the subject of autoboxing and unboxing
- To understand about static methods of the Integer Class

## Terminology

> *Defination* A *wrapper class* wraps (encloses) around a data type and gives it an object appearance. Wherever the data type is required as an object, this object can be instead. Wrapper classes include methods to unwrap the object and give back the original data type. 

##### It can be compared with a chocolate bar. The manufacturer wraps the chocolate bar with some foil or paper to prevent from pollution. The user takes the chocolate, removes the wrapper, throws the wrapper away and then eats it. yum.

Instead of:

```java
Integer i = new Integer(9);
```

use this instead:

```java
Integer l = 9;
```

A primitive-wrapper class in the Java language is one of eight classes provided in the java.lang package to provide object methods for the eight primitive types. All of the primitive wrapper classes in Java are immutable. J2SE 5.0 introduced autoboxing of primitive types into their wrapper object, and automatic unboxing of the wrapper objects into their primitive value—the implicit conversion between the wrapper objects and primitive values.


| Primitive type  | Wrapper Class | Constructor Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `byte` | `Byte` | `byte` or `String` |
| `short` | `Short` | `short` or `String`	 |
| `int` | `Integer` | `int` or `String` |
| `long` | `Long` | `long` or `String` |
| `float` | `Float` | `float`, `double` or `String` |
| `double` | `Double` | `double` or `String` |
| `char` | `Character` | `char` |
| `boolean` | `Boolean` | `boolean` or `String` |


## Terminology

> *Defination* Autoboxing is the term for getting a reference type out of a value type just through type conversion (either implicit or explicit). The compiler automatically supplies the extra source code which creates the object.

> If we move in the opposite direction, then it's called unboxing

![Autoboxing/unboxing](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/AutoBoxing_UnBoxing.png)

##### Below are two examples:

- Value passed as a parameter

```java
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();

numbers.add(5); // Although the add method asks for a parameter of type Integer, we can use 
                // the primitive 5 because it gets automatically autoboxed into 
                // an object of type Integer implicitly.

numbers.add(6);

System.out.println(numbers.get(0)); // prints 5

System.out.println(numbers.get(1)); // prints 6
```

- Value passed to a variable

```java
Integer number = 13;
```


#### Why should you care? 
- Autoboxing/unboxing is heavily used in java collections. More on this later!

### Review of static methods

> *Static method:* A *static method* is a method that belongs to a class, not an instance of the class.

You can call a static method directly on the class.
    
#### For example:

```java
String.format("Formatting the number %d", 9);
```

#### A useful static method  of the Integer class:

```java
static int parseInt(String s) 
```

This method parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer.

The following will generate a compiler error:

```java
String strNum1 = "1000"; 
int val = strNum1;
System.out.println(val);
```

Output:
```java
java: incompatible types
required: int
found: java.lang.String
```

#### Instead use:

```java
String strNum1 = "1000";     
int val = Integer.parseInt(strNum1);
System.out.println(val);
```

Outputs: 1000

#### But be careful:

```java
String strNum1 = "1000cats";
int val = Integer.parseInt(strNum1);
System.out.println(val);
```

Generates a NumberFormatException exception therefore you may wish to properly handle it:

```java
try{

   String strNum1 = "1000cats";
   int val = Integer.parseInt(strNum1);
   System.out.println(val);

} catch (NumberFormatException e){

   System.out.println("Not a proper integer value!");

}
```

Outputs: Not a proper integer value!

##### But atleast the exception is handled and the program execution is able to continue

# In-class assignment: BankAccount & Patron

####Create two classes BankAccount and Patron
- A BankAccount has a balance
- A Patron has a name, an account, and his/her “pocket”.

####For now, our constraints will be:
- A patron can only interact with one account ( 1 <=> 1   )
- An account can interact with many patrons   ( 1 <=> many)
- We will deal with dollars only, no cents

#### Create a program that creates objects of these types and have them interact with each other.

##### Some suggested “interactions”:
- An account should allow withdrawals and deposits
- A patron can get from and put money in the account
- Both should be able to show their current balance

##### Extra Credit:
- Make it so a patron can interact with multiple accounts
- Prevent the possibility of a Patron performing an overwithdrawl
- Prevent the possibility of depositing more than you currently have in your pocket
