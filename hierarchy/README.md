# Hierarchy

Today is your first day on the job as chief technology officer at PS.123 in Flushing, Queens. 
Judy, your boss and acting principal greets you as soon as you walk in and gets you working right away. She tells you 
that she needs a way to represent the "principle to teacher to student relationships" in such a way that she can 
later extract meaningful information from the raw data.

She's provided a diagram which shows these relationships.

She's also gone ahead and created a skeleton for you which is available @ https://github.com/davisRoman/hierarchy
