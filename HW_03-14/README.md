Monkey Treasure

Comments: Please ignore main.java and the last method in Methods.java. I was trying to loop my whole code so that when 
the player dies, they have the option to restart the game inside the console. But I didn't have enough time to finish. 
I have too many loops, I wasn't sure which loop "break" is breaking anymore...
