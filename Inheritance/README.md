# Inheritance

* super class / base class - top level class with subclasses extending it. Every class has a super class of Object
* subclass - extends a superclass to add more unique and specific behavior
* upcast - casting an object to its super type (going up the inheritance tree)
* downcast - casting an object to a specific type from the super class (going down the inheritance tree)
* typecast
* method overriding
* method stubs
* extends - keyword to create a subclass that inherits from the superclass object 
* implements - keyword to create a class that has the contract as defined by an interface
* method signature
* instanceof - keyword to determine if object is of a certain type
* super
* implicit vs explicit
* polymorphism - ability to work with objects interchangeably in the same line of code. Code to the interface type or abstract type so that subclasses can be interchanged into the code. ie. To be able to work against the base class level Person and use any subclass Child, Worker, Student as Person
* abstract - keyword to mark a method signature for method declaration in subclasses. It can also be a type of class that can define partial methods or enforce subclasses to define methods. abstract = incomplete
* overloading - creating multiple verions of a method with the same name but different parameters
* override - creating a new version of a superclass method with an identical method signature, as the superclass method is too general and the subclass needs more specific methods
* public,protected,package-protected,private
